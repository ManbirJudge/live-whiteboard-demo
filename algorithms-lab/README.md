# Algorithms Lab
A place where various smoothing, optimization and all other kinds of algorithms for the **Live White Board Demo** are made, tested and improved.

## TODOS
- Checkout TODOS in top-level `README.md`.
- Complete the Hough Transform algorithm.
  - ~~Better multiple peaks.~~
  - ~~Quantization of the parameter space.~~
  - ~~Implement kernel size for quantization.~~
  - ~~Better quantization of parameter space by slightly decreasing the value of vote added to the surrounding cells as compared to the main cell.~~
  - More efficient Hough transform but IDK how.
